# Large_Inclusion_Mobility
This depository contains the codes used in the paper "Rotational mobility in spherical membranes: The interplay between Saffman-Delbr√ºck length and inclusion size" (DOI: 10.1098/rspa.2024.0473) 
Codes used to generate the figures are in Membrane_Paper_Code.mlx.
Symbolic_Data_300 contains the symbolic data needed for the simulations.
Each figure has its own folder (with the same name as the figure) with the data used to
generate it.
